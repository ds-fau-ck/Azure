What is Azure Data Factory?
● Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a fully managed cloud-based data integration service that enables the creation, scheduling,
and management of data pipelines.
● It is used for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) processes, allowing data movement and
transformation across different services and environments.
Key Features:
● Data Integration: Connect and integrate data from over 90+ supported data sources.
● Data Transformation: Perform data transformation at scale using Mapping Data Flows, SQL, and Python.
● Orchestration: Automate and manage complex data workflows with triggers, control flows, and scheduling.
● Scalability: Scalable processing powered by Azure’s serverless infrastructure.
Core Components of Azure Data Factory
● Pipelines: A logical grouping of activities that together perform a task. A pipeline is the foundation of an ADF workflow.
● Activities: Tasks inside a pipeline, such as Copy Data, Data Flow, Execute SQL, etc.
● Data Flows: Visual, code-free data transformations using Apache Spark. Used for complex data mapping, filtering, joining,
and aggregations.
● Datasets: Representations of data within ADF. Datasets point to data stored in data sources (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, SQL
Server).
● Linked Services: Connections to data sources or compute services. For example, linking to Azure Blob Storage or an
Azure SQL Database.
● Triggers: Mechanisms to start pipelines. Can be time-based (schedule) or event-based (file arrival).
Common Use Cases for Azure Data Factory
● Data Migration: Seamlessly migrate data between different environments (e.g., on-premises to cloud) or between different
cloud services.
● Data Warehousing: Load and transform large volumes of data from diverse sources into a data warehouse, enabling
analytics and reporting.
● Data Orchestration and Automation: Orchestrate complex ETL workflows that require multiple steps and involve
dependencies between activities.
● Big Data Integration: Integrate and process big data from data lakes and IoT devices with support for Hadoop, Spark, and
Databricks.
